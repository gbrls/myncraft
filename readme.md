I usually write my code by expanding upon smaller functional iterations, so it's easy to document.

- Day 2.  
During this day I worked mostly on camera controls and projections, so the graphics didn't really changed.

- Day 3.  
I worked on mesh generation with a DFS to mesh only the visible faces.

- [Day 4](https://github.com/gbrls/myncraft/tree/13989dc41ad2b0b874482c4888649fb4aaf86e07)  
I changed the project structure a little bit and started messing around with terrain generation.

Efficient mesh generation, but it's worse than greedy meshing.
